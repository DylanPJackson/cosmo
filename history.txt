	First installment in formal writing in a .txt file, but much work has
	already been done. Much of the leg work for creating a 'formal' idea was
	done during Quarantine in the Universe notebook. I really have no idea how
	much time was put into that development process. I kinda just sat around
	for days on the couch and wrote my thoughts down as Colin played video
	games. 

	Even before that I've had the idea to create essentially an external
	'Ideal self' since second year. Notably the conversation w/ Sam in Global
	where I had the idea of someone on your shoulder.

	Anyways, the real first part of this project comes not in what code I've
	written, but in the time I've put into thinking about what I want. That is
	more formally written out in the Universe notebook, so won't be discussed
	here.

	The reason I have now begun to document this in a .txt file is because I
	have a formal approach to the first part of the program : Reminders.

	Essentially I've outlined the main tasks that need to get done, and
	exactly what that looks like in terms of what technology I need to use.

	Went through the hassle of find then downloading the right technologies
	Namely, got postgresql pip, and psycopg2 installed. I need postgresql in 
	order to even establish connections to other postgres databases (I think??)
	I needed pip in order to get psycopg2, which is a library that handles
	postgres connections through Python. Planning to make a proof of concept
	program locally to Create / Update / Query the db. Once that is polished,
	I'll ship it over to Alexa. 

	Ran into a minor issue which is cause for some reconsideration. It's one
	thing to connect to the db from the csh machines / rit wifi, but another
	to connect from another network. This means I would have to authenticate
	into the RIT / CSH network and then provide authentication to the db. SO
		1. I need to find some workaround for this. Potentially ask #opcomm
		2. I should just do all development on CSH servers, which includes
		hosting the Alexa backend.

	So looks like port forwarding might work? So, follow this logic :
		In order to connect to universedb regularly, how do I do that?
		1. ssh onto shell using ender
		2. Connect to universe using universe creds
	Tried the above and it uh failed.

	So the RTP's are working on the user machines today, so can't really even
	test the connectivity if I wanted to. Will just need to troubleshoot the
	above solutiona little bit. 

	Instead I worked on the logic for the prioritization function. Initial idea
	uses the Knapsack Problem to put the most amount of value into a given time
	period. Each reminder has a weight, which is the time it takes to complete
	the task. Each reminder also has a priority / value associated with it. 
	Priority is determined by an equation = .8(expiration_date) + .2(creation_date)
	Seems alright after some very brief testing. Going to implement the actual
	knapsack algorithm shortly.
